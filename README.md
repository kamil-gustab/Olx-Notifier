You can choose between two options of notifying

### a) Notifying by telegram message
To do so you first need to configure your `telegram_send` package.

To do so:
1) First create your new telegram bot by writing on telegram to the `BotFather` on telegram, and create new bot by using command `/newbot`.
2) After filling all needed data you will be given you HTTP API token for your bot.
3) In CLI use command `telegram-send configure` - paste your token there, then add your freshly created bot on telegram and send him your activation password (code).
4) Voi'la - you can simply use your bot!

### b) Notifying by mail

For best experience you should use gmail along with per-app-password for your script.
